## Core Formulas

### These are the core math formulas used to generate the amortization schedule

* Total Monthly Payment = (amount loaned) * (rate/1200) / (1 â€“ (1 + rate/1200)(-Number of Months) )

* Remaining Balance before the very first month equals the amount of the loan.

* Interest Payment = Previous Remaining Balance * rate/1200Principal

* Payment = Total Monthly Payment - Interest PaymentAt end each month

* Remaining Balance = Previous Remaining Balance - principal payments
